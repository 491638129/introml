# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python

This repository will be used for instructional material for 
machine learning classes in python.  The material is used for two classes taught at NYU Tandon
by [Sundeep Rangan](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/):

* EE-UY / CS-UY 4563: Introduction to Machine Learning (Undergraduate)
* EL-GY 9123: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate)

However you are free to use this material as well.  Any feedback
is welcome.  The material is limited now, but lectures and demos will
be added over the course of the class.  

Note that labs, homework assignments and lecture notes are given in 
NYU proprietary system NYU Classes and are available only to
students enrolled in the class.  

## Pre-requisites

Both classes assume no python or ML experience.  However, experience
with some programming language (preferably object-oriented) is required.
The class also requires undergraduate probability, 
linear algebra and multi-variable classes.  

## Installation

Before getting started, you will need to install:
* Install [jupyter notebook and Python](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
  Make sure you install Python 3 for the demos in these tutorials.
* Install and familiarize yourself with [github](https://guides.github.com/).
* Later tutorials will require that you install `tensorflow`.

## Sequence
The class will be following the following sequence:
* Basics
    * [Introduction to `numpy` vectors](./Basics/intro_vectors.ipynb)
