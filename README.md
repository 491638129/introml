# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python

This repository provides instructional material for 
machine learning in python.  The material is used for two classes taught at NYU Tandon
by [Sundeep Rangan](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/):

* EE-UY / CS-UY 4563: Introduction to Machine Learning (Undergraduate)
* EL-GY 9123: Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate)

Anyone is free to use and copy this material (at their own risk!).  
Any feedback
is welcome.  The material is very limited now, but lectures and demos will
be added over the course of the class.  

Note that labs, homework assignments and lecture notes are given in 
NYU's proprietary system NYU Classes and are available only to
NYU students enrolled in the class.  

## Pre-requisites

Both classes assume no python or ML experience.  However, experience
with some programming language (preferably object-oriented) is required.
The class also requires undergraduate probability, 
linear algebra and multi-variable calculus.  

## Before you start

You will need to obtain a machine and:
* Install [jupyter notebook and Python](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
  Make sure you install Python 3 for the demos in these tutorials.
* Install and familiarize yourself with [github](https://guides.github.com/).
* Later tutorials will require that you install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

If you do not wish to run the code on your personal machine, all the software can
be run in the cloud.  We provide detailed 
[instructions](./GCP/readme.md) on setting up a VM for this class in 
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

## Sequence
The class will be following the following [sequence](sequence.md)
