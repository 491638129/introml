# How to Follow This Course

The class will be using the following order.  But, you may choose to 
skip over components if you know them already.  Right now, we have very 
little material.  But, more will be added over the course of the class.

**Caution**:  A lot of material is not covered in the demos.
In this class, much is taught as part of the labs that the students do.

* [Setting up python in GCP](./GCP/readme.md).  Only necessary if you are using 
GCP and not your local machine.
* [Introduction to `numpy` vectors](./Basics/intro_vectors.ipynb)
* [Simple linear regression](./simp_lin_reg/readme.md)
    * [Demo:  Understanding automobile mpg](./simp_lin_reg/auto_mpg.ipynb)
