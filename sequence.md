# How to Follow This Course

The class will use the following order.  But, for those not enrolled in 
the class, feel free to browse in any order suitable for you.  
Right now, we have very little material.  But, more will be added over the course of the class.

Ultimately, each topic will have a **demo** where the concepts are illustrated.
This is what we cover in the lectures in class.  Then, the students complete a similar
exercise on a new dataset in the **lab** at home.  Note the demo component does not 
generally cover
all topics, since some concepts are left for the students to figure out 
for themselves in the labs.  Also, as you will observe, the labs are 
just empty skeletons with `TODO` markers that the students fill in.  
Students will be provided the full solutions in class.  If you are an instructor
and wish copies of the solutions for yourself, please contact Sundeep Rangan at <srangan@nyu.edu>.
